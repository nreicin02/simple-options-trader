# Product Requirements Document: SimpliOptions

## Language & Project Info
- **Language**: English
- **Programming Language**: Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Project Name**: simpli_options

### Original Requirements
Create a platform that has a simple UI/UX and allows the casual retail trader to trade options. Options are normally very difficult to trade because they use confusing language and are hard to understand. The platform should use plain language describing what exactly the trader is betting on. It should be better integrated with a financial services provider than existing platforms like Kalshi.
